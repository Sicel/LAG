  sentences:
  - Hey.
  - Psst! Hey! You with the port!
  - "Come on, there\u2019s literally no one else here."
  - I turn to face the girl, hoping to get this over as quickly as possible
  - "Ah, great. I noticed that you uh\u2026 have that port on your head. Does it do
    what I think it does?"
  - I guess that depends.
  - "I mean, you know\u2026 I heard it can do neat things. Can\u2019t it transfer
    souls?"
  - I have no idea what you're talking about.
  - "Oh come on, don\u2019t try to pull that. You and I both know exactly what it
    does."
  - "I just want one small favor. Just one. I\u2019ll give you plenty of scripts too."
  - Just name your price.
  - I'm about to tell her to leave me alone when I look up at the new scroll
  - 'WANTED FOR INSUBORDINATION: KANA-0571. REWARD GRANTED ON RETURN, BODY OR SOUL'
  - Alright, I'll give you a chance
  - Thank you! Thank you so much!
