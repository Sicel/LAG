#### Keywords

-   3D Walking Simulator
-   Cyberpunk
-   Heavy Narrative

#### Platforms(s)

-   Desktop (PC)

#### Target Player Experience

We want the player to become invested in the story of the player character and the ghost the player is helping as they explore the world around them.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechanic
    -   Walking / Exploring the city block
1.  Secondary Mechanics
    -   Interacting with objects
1.  Progression
    -   Progression will be based on exploring the environment and character interactions, and getting closer to fulfilling the ghost's goal. Once the ghost's dilemma is resolved, the game has been won.
1.  Narrative
    -   The narrative will explore how the player character and the other person (people?) in his mind interact. The player character       will be able to help these people, and eventually find his purpose in life. 

#### Minimal Viable Interaction
There is only one anime ghost for the player to absolve. The player will have one city block to explore, and items and events are scattered throughout to help the player absolve the ghost.

#### References

1. **VA-11 Hall-A**: A visual novel where you play as a bartender. It plays like a visual novel, but conversation routes are determined by what drinks you make. We wanted to capture the visual mood, and the feeling of the characters. 
1. **The Stanley Parable**: The Stanley Parable has you control Stanley, an office worker as an omniscient narrator gives you a script to follow. The joy of the game comes from exploring different routes and veering off the path set by the narrator. We want to capture the walking sim perspective and freedom of choice. Freedom of choice might be a stretch goal, but this is a good reference point.
1. **Ghost Voices (music video)**: the ghosts shown around the 52s mark are perfect
1. **Cyberpunk 2077**: This cyberpunk style is what we're going after
