#### Keywords

-   3D Walking Simulator
-   Cyberpunk
-   Heavy, Dark Narrative

#### Platforms(s)

-   PC

#### Target Player Exerience

We want the player to become invested in the story of the player character and the girl the player is helping as they explore the world around them.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   Walking and looking around
    

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   Interacting with objects


3.  Progression

    -   Progression will be based on exploring the environment and character interactions. As the "rider" in our player's mind is ready     to leave, the game will be completed. 


4.  Narrative

    -   The narrative will explore how the player character and the other person (people?) in his mind interact. The player character       will be able to help these people, and eventually find his purpose in life. 


#### Minimal Viable Interaction

We want to build a simple area of the world where the player can walk around. They will be able to interact with certain objects that will trigger dialogue.

#### References

Pease add a short description of how this is relevant to your game (mechanic, art, theme, etc.). There is no limit to how many references you can have.

1. VA-11 Hall-A: A visual novel where you play as a bartender. It plays like a visual novel, but conversation routes are determined by what drinks you make. We wanted to capture the visual mood, and the feeling of the characters. 

2. The Stanley Parable: The Stanley Parable has you control Stanley, an office worker as an omniscient narrator gives you a script to follow. The joy of the game comes from exploring different routes and veering off the path set by the narrator. We want to capture the walking sim perspective and freedom of choice. Freedom of choice might be a stretch goal, but this is a good reference point.

3. Ghost Voices (music video): the ghosts shown around the 52s mark are perfect
